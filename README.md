# Application for CPU Usage calculation
For the NodeJS application, I created a back-end server with express where I used the process.cpuUsage() method, and I set up a back-end API that returns the result of this method which is an object containing properties like user and system, with some integer value that signifies time elapsed by the process, measured in microseconds. 
For the React application, I set up a proxy in package.json file on the front-end and used the useEffect hook to fetch the API and then store the data that the back-end returned using the useState hook. To display the data I imported a container from Semantic UI in a component called Calculation where I used the variable storing the back-end data , and I added a component Header to display a simple header containing the application title, then I imported the two components in the file App.js
